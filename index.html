    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey there! I’m Ayesha Khan, a sleep enthusiast by day and same by night coz I'm a sleeping Don(not beauty). When I’m not busy coding or pretending to be a hacker, you can find me binge-watching tutorials on "how to take over the world" (just kidding, or am I?).</p>
    <p>I have a passion for solving complex problems(that's another thing_ instead of solving problems, I end up causing trouble for everyone including myself) and breaking down systems (legally, of course). My goal? To save the world from bad code and overly complicated passwords.Now that was a joke,hehe.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Project 1:</strong> Built a full-stack web app for managing personal finances. Spoiler: I still can't manage mine, everytime messing up things.</li>
        <li><strong>Project 2:</strong> Developed a mobile app for learning ethical hacking. For legal purposes, I promise this is not what it sounds like(keep that in mind).</li>
        <li><strong>Project 3:</strong> Created a Python tool for automating network security tasks. My computer is now smarter than me. Help! Sshhh don't tell anybody I don't have brain basically, hehe</li>
